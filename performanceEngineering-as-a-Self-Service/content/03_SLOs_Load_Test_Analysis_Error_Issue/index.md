## SLOs and Load Test Analysis Error Issue

THe Google’s SRE Handbook mostly focuses on the production use case for SLIs/SLOs, Dynatrace is “Shifting-Left” this approach and using SLIs/SLOs

While an SLI is just a metric, an SLO just a threshold you expect your SLI to be in and SLA is just the business contract on top of an SLO. It’s great that this discipline and ideas have got a lot of attention lately.

“The earlier in the lifecycle we ensure SLIs meet their SLOs the better it will to ensure these service levels in production”.

In this lab we walk through how to create SLOs in Dynatrace that can be used in your Performance Testing and we will also troubleshoot why a Availability/Error SLO failed.
