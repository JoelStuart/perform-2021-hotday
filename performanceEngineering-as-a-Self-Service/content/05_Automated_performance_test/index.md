## Automated Performance Test

### Deployment automation 
Deployment automation is about the automated implementation of your application’s build, deploy, test 
and release process. In general, the automated deployment process is initiated whenever a developer 
commits code to a software repository inside the version control system (VCS) such as Subversion or Git. 
When the build automation server, which acts as the pipeline’s control center, such as Jenkins, 
observes a change in the repository, it triggers a sequence of stages which examine a build from 
different angles via automated tests, but terminates immediately in case of failure. Only when a build 
passes all stages it is regarded to be of sufficient quality to be released into production.
