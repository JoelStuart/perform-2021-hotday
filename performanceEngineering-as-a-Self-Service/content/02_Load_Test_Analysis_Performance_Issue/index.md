## Load Test Analysis Performance Issue

Now that we have our KIAB installed. 

Let's start by viewing a dashboard.

Click **"Dashboards"** from the Main Navigation menu.

Then Select the **"Autonomous Cloud Concepts with Keptn"** Dashboard.

Now you should see your Dashboard.

<img src="../../assets/images/lab_1-acck-details.png" width="500"/>

Next we will create a few configuration items and kick off a load test.

### Configuration

1.	Create a service tag
2.  Process Detection Naming rule
3.  Run first Load Test
4.  Describe Dynatrace Load Test Request Attribute
4.  Describe Calculated Service Metrics for Load Test Steps
5.  Kick off Keptn Customer 2 Build
6.  Describe Dynatrace Load Test Request Header
7.  Update Keptn: keptnorders staging Management Zone
8.  Create KeptnOdersDatabase Database Service Rule Name
9.  Examine Performance Test Dashboard with Transaction Steps
10.  Load Test Performance Analysis

### Create Service tag

To support tagging, Dynatrace provides both a manual approach (Settings > Tags > Manually applied tags) and an automated, rule-based approach (Settings > Tags > Automatically applied tags).

We are going to apply a manual tag for this exercise.

First we need to create a tag on the service.
Navigate to **Transactions and services>frontend** 

<img src="../../assets/images/lab1_frontend_service.png" width="500"/>

We are looking for **frontend** with **keptnorders.staging.frontend [direct]**

Now we can create the **"evalservice"** tag.

<img src="../../assets/images/lab1_service_tag.png" width="500"/>

### Create Process Group Naming Rule

Go to **"Settings>Processes and Containers>Process group naming"**

<img src="../../assets/images/lab_1_gettoprocessgroup.png" width="500"/>

Then select "add new rule"

Now we will create the rule with the following parameters.

<img src="../../assets/images/lab_1_process_group_name.png" width="500"/>

You can cut and paste these items.

* Rule name: **Keptn Processgroup Naming**
* Process group naming format: **{ProcessGroup:Environment:keptn_project}.{ProcessGroup:Environment:keptn_stage}.{ProcessGroup:Environment:keptn_service} [{ProcessGroup:Environment:keptn_deployment}]**
* Conditions: **keptn_deployment (Environment)**

Click **"Preview"** -> **"create rule"** -> **"save changes"**

### Kick off our first load test

Login to Jenkins

* username = keptn
* password = keptn

<img src="../../assets/images/Lab_1_Jenkins_Log_In.png" width="500"/>

We are going to run the **03-simpletest-qualitygate pipeline**.
Click **"build"** this initial build will fail.
Refresh the page, now we can do a **"Build with Parameters"**

We need to change the Deployment URL

<img src="../../assets/images/lab_1_simple_test.png" width="500"/>

Click **Build**


### Describe Dynatrace Load Test Request Attribute

While executing a load test from your load testing tool of choice (JMeter, Neotys, LoadRunner, etc.) each simulated HTTP request can be tagged with additional HTTP headers that contain test-transaction information (for example, script name, test step name, and virtual user ID).

Dynatrace can analyze incoming HTTP headers and extract such contextual information from the header values and tag the captured requests with request attributes. Request attributes enable you to filter your monitoring data based on defined tags.

You can use any (or multiple) HTTP headers or HTTP parameters to pass context information. The extraction rules can be configured via ```Settings --> Server-side service monitoring --> Request attributes```.

The header ```x-dynatrace-test``` is used one or more key/value pairs for the header. Here are some examples:

| **Key**   | **Description**   |
| --- | --- |
| VU  | Virtual User ID of the unique user who sent the request.  |
| SI  | Source ID identifies the product that triggered the request (JMeter, LoadRunner, Neotys, or other)  |
| TSN  | Test Step Name is a logical test step within your load testing script (for example, Login or Add to cart.  |
| LSN  | Load Script Name - name of the load testing script. This groups a set of test steps that make up a multi-step transaction (for example, an online purchase).  |
| LTN  | The Load Test Name uniquely identifies a test execution (for example, 6h Load Test – June 25)  |
| PC  | Page Context provides information about the document that is loaded in the currently processed page.  |

### Describe Calculated Service Metrics for Load Test Steps



### Kick off Keptn Customer 2 Build

Click on **01_deploy_order_application** pipeline

<img src="../../assets/images/Lab_1_deploy_order_application_1.png" width="500"/>

Now we are going to push the **customer** version **2**.

Select **"Build with parameters"**

Then we need to change the build for customer to version 2 and select the build for **Customer**
