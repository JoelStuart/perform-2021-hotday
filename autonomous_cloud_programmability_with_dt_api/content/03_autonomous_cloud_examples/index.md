## Autonomous Cloud Examples

In this module, you will learn about metric ingestion which provides a simple way to push any custom metric to Dynatrace. There are a number of different ways we can go about this but in today's examples we will be focusing on the following channels:

- Scripting integration (dynatrace_ingest)
- Metrics API v2
- OneAgent REST API

### Examples

- Logged in Users (dynatrace_ingest)
- Logged in Usernames, IP, Session (OneAgent REST API)
- Failed SSH Attempts (Metrics API v2)
- COVID Cases (External API via Metrics API v2)
