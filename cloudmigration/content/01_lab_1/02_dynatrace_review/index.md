## Dynatrace Review

Referring to the picture below, here are the components for lab 1.

**#1 . Demo App**

Sample app representing a "monolith" architecture of a frontend and backend.  The application was implemented as two Docker containers that we will review in this lab within Dynatrace.

ðŸ’¥ **TECHNICAL NOTE**: A real scnenario would often start with the application components running on a physical or virtualzied host in on-prem and not "Dockerized". In Dynatrace, Java, Apache and Docker containers all show up as "processes".  So for our workshop, we took that step that is often done in modernization, "Dockerize" the application if it is small enough.

**#2 . Dynatrace monitoring**

The Dynatrace OneAgent was preinstalled and is sending data to your Dynatrace SaaS environment. 

**#3 . Load generator process**

Two docker processes that loop to send simulated user traffic to the sample app.  You will not need to interact with these, they just run in the background.

## OneAgent

The host running the sample application was created by the Dynatrace University team using scripts to install and run the Sample Application and to install the Dynatrace OneAgent.

We don't have to install the OneAgent, but we can review its status by choosing the `Deployment status` option from the left side menu to open the OneAgent deployment page.

ðŸ’¥ **TECHNICAL NOTE**: Dynatrace University has a few interfaces that run before the OneAgent was installed. So some warnings are OK.

To see how the OneAgent gets installed

1. Choose the `Deploy Dynatrace` option from the left side menu to open the OneAgent deployment page. 
1. Pick the `OneAgent` under the `Start monitoring` section.
