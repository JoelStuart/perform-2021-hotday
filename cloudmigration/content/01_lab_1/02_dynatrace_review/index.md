## Dynatrace Review

Referring to the picture below, here are the components for lab 1.

**#1 . Demo App**

Sample app representing a "monolith" architecture of a front and and backend.  The application was implemented as two Docker containers that we will review in this lab within Dynatrace.

**#2 . Dynatrace monitoring**

the Dynatrace OneAgent was preinstalled and is sending data to your Dynatrace SaaS environment.  We will review this next.

**#3 . Load generator process**

Two docker processes that loop to send simulated user traffic to the sample app.  You will not need to interact with these, they just run in the background.

## OneAgent

The host running the sample application was created by the Dynatrace University team using scripts to install and run the Sample Application as well as to install the Dynatrace OneAgent.

To see the running OneAgent, choose the `Deployment status` option from the left side menu to open the OneAgent deployment page.

To see how the OneAgent gets installed

1. Choose the `Deploy Dynatrace` option from the left side menu to open the OneAgent deployment page. 
1. Pick the `OneAgent` under the `Start monitoring` section.
