## Service

Web applications consist of web pages that are served by web servers and web application processses, for example Tomcat. Web and mobile applications are built upon services that process requests like web requests, web service calls, and messaging. 

Such "server-side services" can take the form of web services, web containers, database requests, custom services, and more. Services may in turn call other services such as web services, remote services, and databases services.

## How this helps

Knowing the type of access, executed statements, and amount of data transferred during regular hours of operation allows for better planning and prioritization of the move groups. In some cases, you may decide to not migrate this database in favor of other services or databases that are less complex to migrate due to fewer dependencies.
