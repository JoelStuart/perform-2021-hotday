## Lab 3 Overview

Often the monitoring tools oranizations use simply donâ€™t work in the complex ecosystem of microservices and for technologies like Kubernetes.

Finding root cause of problems harder than ever before and the effort required goes beyond what is humanly possible when the application spans to the cloud providers and data centers and the explosion of interconnected services. There are more possibilities for failures and more hiding spots for problems to sneak into the environment when software driving more than just the application.

In this lab, we will trigger a few problem and see how troubleshooting time is Significantly reduced by letting AI automatically detect problems and pinpoints the root cause, explaining business impact with no manual configurations.

## Objectives of this Lab

ðŸ”· Enable a problem in the application and walk through what Davis found

ðŸ”· Review ways to analyze the before and after of re-architectured applications

ðŸ”· Review Dynatrace configuration rules
