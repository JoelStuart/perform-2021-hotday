## Summary

While migrating to the cloud, you want to evaluate if your migration goes according to the plan, whether the services are still performing well or even better than before, and whether your new architecture is as efficient as the blueprint suggested. Dynatrace helps you validate all these steps automatically, which helps speed up the migration and validation process.

Having the ability to understand service flows enables us to make smarter re-architecture and re-platforming decisions.  With support for new technologies like Kubernetes, you have confidence to modernize with a platform that span the old and the new.
