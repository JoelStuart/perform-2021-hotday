## Open Backtrace Page

To see the backtrace page, just click on the `Analyze Backtrace` button.

You should be on the service backtrace page where you will see information for this specific service.

This will get more interesting in the next lab, but for the monolith backend, we can see that the backtrace is as follows:

1 . The starting point is the **scripts_backend-service_1**

2 . **scripts_backend-service_1** is called by the **scripts_front-end_1**

3 . **scripts_front-end_1** is a where end user requests start and the user sessions get captured within the **My web application** by default
