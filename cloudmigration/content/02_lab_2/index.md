## Lab 2 Overiew

Re-hosting (also referred to as lift and shift) is a common migration use case. Re-architecture and Re-platform are steps that break the traditional monolithic architectures and replace individual components with cloud services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), which replaces on-premises relational databases) and Amazon DynamoDB, which replaces NoSQL databases. These steps can also replace newly-developed microservices, including containerized or serverless.

We just learned how we can get great information on services, processes and user requests using Dynatrace and OneAgent. This helps us now decide what individual features or complete applications based on business benefits we need to migrate and modernize. The idea here is to focus on feature-based business benefit with functional migration.

## Objectives of this Lab

ðŸ”· Review how the sample app went from monolith to microservices

ðŸ”· Review how Dynatrace monitors Kubernetes

ðŸ”· Examine the transformed application using service flows and back traces
