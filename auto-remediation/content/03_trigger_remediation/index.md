## Trigger Remediation

In this lab we will trigger the ansible AWX template called `Trigger Memory Leak on Backend` that will enable the `MediumMemoryLeak` easyTravel plugin which will result in a memory exhaustion problem detected and generated by dynatrace.

1. In Ansible AWX, navigate to `Templates` and click on the "rocket" icon next to the template named `Trigger Memory Leak on Backend`.

1. After a few minutes a new problem will be created on dynatrace:

    ![dynatrace-problem](../../assets/images/dynatrace-problem.png)

1. A new Alert will also be created on ServiceNow:

    ![servicenow-alert](../../assets/images/servicenow-alert.png)

1. There will be an Incident attached to the alert with the `Assignment group` among other fields already populated:

1. You can check the status of the flow execution by going to the `alert executions tab` on the bottom of the alert and clicking on the triggered remediaton subflow:
