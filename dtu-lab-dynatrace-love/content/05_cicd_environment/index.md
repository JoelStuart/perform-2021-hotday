## CICD Environment with Intelligent QualityGates

The basis of this section is for understanding the set-up and methodology behind automatic quality gates. There is a hughe amount of value building an automatic quality gate based on performance tests with release validations and comparisons. With best practices you can achieve validations on functional, architectural, infrastructure, performance and business levels, **automatically**. 

This 🏎 speeds_up not only the delivery but also the quality of the software by detecting issues faster on code-changes being merged or pushed to a release branch. Dynatrace is continuously capturing on real-time high-resolution information through the whole stack and on all layers. This information can and should be used for optimizing your software continuously. 

By building intelligent quality gates, you increase the quality of your software and free-up valuable resources (Performance Engineers and Developers) so they can focus on **"Building Better Software Faster"**
