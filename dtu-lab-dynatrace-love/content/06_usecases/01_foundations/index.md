## Foundations of Loadtest analysis

- Show the service flow of the “9 - Finish Payment” test step (of any release)

- Show the exceptions and the impacted TestSteps of a Loadtest of the last 6 hours.

> The "EasyTravel Webserver" is the entrypoint for the sessionbased LoadTests (and the validation of Keptn based on the Tag `easytravel-azdo`). The Deployment events are displayed on this Service.
> Tip: For finding a specific load test with the deployment events on the service
> - either display the events for the last 6 hours
> - enter the time to a fix hour `08:00 to 09:00` and then navigate back or forward
