- amount of requests vs responsetime 95th percentile
- network status
- HTTP errors and failed transactions
- Database calls and time spent in database per transaction
- most failing services 
- service throughput
- slowest services
- db calls per service
- JVM CPU by ThreadGroup
- GC by Poolname
- Memory Allocation Objects by API
