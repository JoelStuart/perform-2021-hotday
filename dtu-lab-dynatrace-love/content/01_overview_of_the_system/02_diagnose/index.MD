## Diagnosing the Health of an Environment
Leveraging tags and Management Zones you can get very fast and easy an understanding of UX, transactions, hosts, application network traffic, failures on the whole environment or on specific stages, departments, subcompanies, etc.

In this example you can get an overview of:

- the amount and health of databases, services, hosts and applications.
- amount of requests vs responsetime 95th percentile
- network status
- HTTP errors and failed transactions
- Database calls and time spent in database per transaction
- most failing services 
- service throughput
- slowest services
- database calls per service
- service time spent in wait, lock, IO and CPU
- JVM CPU by ThreadGroup
- GC by Poolname
- Memory Allocation Objects by API
