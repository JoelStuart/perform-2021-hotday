## Collaboration

We will use Zoom for communicating, presenting and showing our pretty 💁‍♀️ faces. Now,there might be times you would like to share links, or you want to post a question, for that we have a live "notepad" collaboration. In the dashboard look for the **🙋‍♂️ collaboration** link.

Let's use the notepad for sharing ideas, content and Q&As. Use the Zoom session for speaking up whatever is on your mind, just bear in mind that we have a tight schedule. Written questions there can be answered in an ordered fashion and others can learn.
