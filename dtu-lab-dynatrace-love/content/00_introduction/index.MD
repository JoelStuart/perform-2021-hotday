## Introduction, Prerequisites and Deliverables


### Introduction 
This is not a product tutorial.
There is no need to be an AWS or Azure expert and everything we are covering can be applied to ANY environment (e.g. Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, On-Prem, etc‚Ä¶)

The goal of this sessions is:
Help you become more comfortable using Dynatrace to diagnose application problems, understand the service dependencies, the architecture and know how and where to optimize.
Help you diagnose the overall health of an environment from thousands of services all the way to threads, exceptions and response times of a single transaction end-2-end through all layers (FullStack).
Understand the added-value for developers to have an automated qualitygate in the CI/CD pipeline.
Make the diagnosis easy for others in your organization
Not everybody needs to be a ‚ÄúDynatrace Expert‚Äù
Understand how you can leverage Davis so she helps you monitor and diagnose applications.
