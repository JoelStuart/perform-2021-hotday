## What we’re covering/not covering

- This is not a product tutorial (although we will demo and show new features of the product)
  
- We will cover some best practices on Loadtesting and Release comparison so you can apply this in you company and help release better software faster.
The software optimizations and analysis can be done [in any technology that Dynatrace can monitor](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/technology-support/supported-technologies-and-versions/)

- There is no need to be an Azure or AWS expert and everything we are covering can be applied to ANY environment (e.g. Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, On-Prem, etc…) and any modern CI/CD Pipeline that can be triggered via REST.
