## Prerequisites 

- You bring a basic understanding of Performance Engineering & Services Architecture
- You ðŸ’œ Dynatrace ðŸ¤“
- You have worked with the product and want to learn more
- The Dynatrace Associate certification is recommended although Dynatrace Professional would beÂ preferred. We will be working on a preconfigured environment with automated tagging, request attributes, API detection rules, application definitions, Managed Zones and Calculated Metrics just to name a few configurations. We will leverage the diagnostics based on these settings and it's important that a basic understanding of them is given.Â 
- The HandsOn environment is an "Integration" environment linked with an endless CI/CD Azure DevOps Pipeline deploying bad builds and we will leverage Keptn for Performance as a Service and comparison of each release in an integrated automated quality gate.As Performance Engineers we will use Dynatrace to understand and analyze code changes on failed releases. A basic understanding on loadtesting and CI/CD pipelines is recommended. If you are unfamiliar with Keptn and AzureDevOps here is a Webinar that shows automating quality gates in Azure DevOps with Keptn https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgCizWLVsPc
