### Run the lab yourself

If you want to run the lab yourself you need
1. A k8s cluster
2. A Dynatrace Tenant
3. A host that is connected to the internet and connected to the k8s cluster

To install the lab environment on your k8s:
1. Clone the github repository on your host
2. Execute all scripts under the setup folder!

After that you are good to go to continue with the lab
