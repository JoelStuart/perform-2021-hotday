## Exercise

Our lab environment now has a handful of issue tracker queries configured pulling issue statistics from our hotday GitHub repository.
Your exercise is now to do do the following

### Exercise 1: Validate that the existing queries work
Open the Release inventory and validate that the existing queries return data.
Also validate with filters, e.g: filter on a students application or a specific version!

### Exercise 2: Create additional Issues in GitHub with correct labels
Create one or two new issues for a particular version or application. Labels have been pre-defined so feel free to set them as you like!

### Exercise 3: Validate these new issues show up in Dynatrace
Validate that these new issues show up in the Release Inventory screen!
